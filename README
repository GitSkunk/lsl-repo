For documentation, please refer to
https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/How_to_make_writing_LSL_scripts_easier
or the "wiki.txt" contained in this repository.


The wiki article is about tools you can use to make creating LSL
scripts easier.  It tries to explain how to combine and how to use
them for this very purpose.

The contents of this repository provide a build system and examples
for creating LSL scripts.


Reference implementations of rfedip devices are included.  Please see
https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LSL_Protocol/rfedip about this.


The sources in this repo may be more recent than the sources and
scripts in the wiki articles.  Files used by the build system, header
files, library files and files for emacs etc. will be kept up to
date.  You may want to watch this repo.

If you would like to contribute, itÂ´s probably a good idea to fork
