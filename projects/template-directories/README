template-directories


This directory contains directories and files required by the build
system.  Do not modify anything in this directory unless you know what
you´re doing.


For every new project, make a complete copy of the
template-directories:


cp -axv template-directories new-project


All files relevant for your project can (should) be contained in this
directory (new-project).

avn: The build system creates header files that define the symbol
     'VERSION'. It puts the headers into the avn directory.  You can
     include these headers into your sources with '#include
     <avn/name.h>', "name.h" being the name of a particular script in
     the source directory.  For every file in the source directory, a
     header is created in the avn directory.


     The version number is created as follows:

     + If file ./version-name exists, read the version from the first
       line of the file.

     + else
       If file ./version exists, read the version from the first line
       of the file

     + else
       If the project directory appears to be a git repository,
       attempt to use git to create a version.

     + else
       The version is undefined.

       A debugging version of the script which retains all comments
       from the source files is created in the avn directory.  This
       isn´t the ideal place to put it, but it doesn´t hurt ...


bin: The LSL scripts to use.  These are shrunken versions of the
     scripts which tend to use less script memory than non-shrunken
     versions.


dbg: Debugging versions of the LSL scripts.


dep: Automatically created files used by the build system to figure
     out dependencies.


doc: You can put your project documentation into this directory.


lib: This is a directory for project-specific headers and library
     files.  Files in this directory can be included with '#include
     <filename>'.  Automatically created headers are kept separate in
     the avn directory.


Makefile: By default, all projects use the same Makefile, located in
	  the ../make directory.  This is a symlink.  If the project
	  requires an adjusted Makefile, remove the symlink and copy
	  the Makefile from the ../make directory to adjust the copy.


README: this file


src: The directory to put your sources into, like 'script.lsl'.


A license (or another file) can be automatically prepended to the
generated LSL scripts.  Create a file ./license or ./license-name in
this directory, similar to the automatic versioning:  ./license will
be prepended to all generated LSL scripts; ./license-name will be
prepended to dbg/name.i and bin/name.o.
