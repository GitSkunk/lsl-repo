Problems/bugs to fix:

+ inefficiency of loops using llGetListLength() in loop condition

+ handle_message() confuses the UUID of an agent with the UUID of an
  object when a message is transmitted by whisper

+ the sitter script should remove the listener once the UUID of the
  object that rezzed it has transmitted its UUID

+ the main script pretty much ignores that the run_time_permissions()
  event is also triggered when the permission is denied

+ unused variables
