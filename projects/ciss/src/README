Problems/bugs to fix:

+ inefficiency of loops using llGetListLength() in loop condition

+ handle_message() confuses the UUID of an agent with the UUID of an
  object when a message is transmitted by whisper

+ the sitter script should remove the listener once the UUID of the
  object that rezzed it has transmitted its UUID

+ the main script ignores that the run_time_permissions() event is
  triggered when the permission is denied

+ unused variables

+ why has the main script in the included example object only 8kB
  memory left free?

+ the script is unaware of inventory changes, like through adding
  animations

+ the main script does not detect the root prim when the prim is not
  linked

+ the main script may run out of memory when in an object that
  consists of many prims

+ potential problems with CSV conversion of strings with comma and
  pointy brackets are ignored

+ finding the key of an animation can silently fail

+ using llSensor() in a timer event can yield unexpected results

+ using a sensor to detect agents is not a good idea because the range
  is limited and only the closest 16 agents can be detected

+ there´s something else I wanted to check and don´t remember atm


Shan Bright claims the script doesn´t have any bugs or issues and
didn´t even want to see the list.

It seems easier to make a rewrite from scratch than to fix the
problems.  Perhaps I´ll do that some time.

Other than formatting the script, I haven´t changed anything.
